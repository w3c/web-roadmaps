        <p data-feature="Camera and mike capture">Cameras and microphones available on a huge number of devices can be exploited from Web browsers via the <a data-featureid="getusermedia">Media Capture and Streams API</a>.</p>

          <h2>Specifications in progress</h2>
          <p data-feature="Recording">Any media content captured, generated or received as a stream can be recorded via the <a data-featureid="recording">Media Recorder API</a>.</p>
          <p data-feature="Screen capture">Media content generated or viewed on a given Web application can be turned itself into a media stream (for recording or transmission) via the <a data-featureid="domcapture">Media Capture from DOM elements</a> API. More generally, content produced by any other application (or the whole of the display) can also be turned into such a stream via the <a data-featureid="screencapture">Screen Capture API</a>.</p>

          <p data-feature="Photography API">The <a data-featureid="imagecapture">Mediastream Image Capture</a> specification caters or more advanced usage of cameras that offer still-pictures settings (e.g. to control zoom or white-balance).</p>
          <p data-feature="3D Camera capture">As depth-sensing cameras come to the market, the <a data-featureid="3dcamera">Media Capture Depth Stream Extensions</a> allows to capture the additional dimension in information they produce.</p>

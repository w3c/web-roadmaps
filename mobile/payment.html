            <p>Native mobile application stores have made it much easier for developers to monetize some of their applications, 
                either by selling the application itself to users, or by providing in-app purchases.</p>
            
            <p>While Web applications can use well-known on-line payment solutions, these solutions have so far proved much 
                harder to use on mobile devices.</p>
            
            
            <div data-feature="Web Payment">
                <p>In March 2014, W3C organized a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/">workshop on Web payments</a> to 
                    identify ways in which standards could help make that payment experience much simpler, in particular on mobile
                    devices. In Octobober 2014, W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/04/payments/webpayments_charter.html">chartered</a>
                    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payment Interest Group</a> to drive work in this space, and that 
                    group released <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">its sense of priority use cases for Web payments</a>.</p>

                <p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/06/payments-wg-charter.html">charter for a Web Payments Working Group</a> is now 
                    under review by the W3C Advisory Committee: this group, if chartered, would develop a browser API to facilitate 
                    payment operations in Web apps.</p> 
                
                <p>Meanwhile, HTML5.1 provides specific help for <strong><a data-featureid="autocomplete-cc">autocomplete of credit card details</a></strong>, 
                    making it easier to pay via credit cards once these details have been entered once.</p>

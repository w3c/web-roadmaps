      <h1>Device Adaptation</h1>
      <p>Mobile devices not only differ widely from traditional computers, but they also have a lot of variations among themselves, in term of screen size, resolution, type of keyboard, media recording capabilities, etc.</p>

          <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
      <p data-feature="Device information">The <a data-featureid="ddr">Device Description Repository API</a> is a unified server-side API that allows Web developers to retrieve data on the devices that are accessing their pages on a variety of device information database.</p>
      <div data-feature="CSS-based adaptation">
        <p><a data-featureid="mediaqueries">CSS Media Queries</a> offer a mechanism that allows adapting the layout and behavior of a Web page based on some of the characteristics of the device, including the screen resolution — to which <a  data-featureid="mediaqueries4">Media Queries Level 4</a> proposes to add the availability and type of a pointing device, the ability to hover over elements, and the ambient luminosity. Moreover, <data-featureid="mediaqueries5">Media Queries Level 5</a> lets developers the ability to define media queries that <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#script-custom-mq">react to script-defined variables</a>, making it easier to integrate these adaptation rules in the overall logic of the app.</p>
        <p>The <a data-featureid="viewport-units">viewport-relative CSS units <code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code></a> let design layouts that adapt to the dimensions of the viewport, representing a percentage of the current viewport dimensions.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-feature="Responsive images">
      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/respimg/">Responsive Images Community Group (RICG)</a> developed an extension to HTML, known as the <a data-featureid="picture"><code>picture</code> element</a>, that allows authors define what image to load depending on device capabilities and/or other media features.</p>
      <p>As a complementary approach, the <a data-featureid="srcset"><code>srcset</code> attribute</a>, specified by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/whatwg/">WHATWG</a> and also published as an extension to HTML, let Web developers define the various device pixel ratios of an image, letting the browser pick the best choice for the pixel density of the screen.</p>
      <p><a data-featureid="svg12">SVG</a>, which lets define images that can be scaled up and down without any loss of quality, is another critical tool to the development of Web applications that adapt to the resolution of the underlying device.</p>

        <section class="featureset in-progress">
          <h2>Specifications in progress</h2>
          <p data-feature="Media Capture Capabilities">The <a data-featureid="getusermedia-cap">Media Capture and Streams</a> API exposes some specific information on capabilities of camera and microphones to make it possible to take advantage of the large variety of media capturing devices provided on mobile phones.</p>

          <div data-feature="CSS-based adaptation">
          <p><a data-featureid="css-device-adapt">CSS Device Adaptation</a> defines a set of CSS directives to define the size on which this layout should be based, relatively to the size of the underlying device — specifying what has been implemented using the <code>&lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;</code> element so far.</p>

  <h2>Exploratory work</h2>

  <div data-feature="CSS-based adaptation">
    <p><a data-featureid="css-size-adjust">CSS Mobile Text Size Adjustment</a> lets text adapt to zoomed parts of a page.</p>
  </div>

  <div data-feature="JS-based adaptation">
    <p>Most mobile devices feature on-screen keyboards for user input. They also commonly let the user zoom in on a page. Both of these features preserve the <em>layout viewport</em> (what the web page uses when laying out its user interface), so as not to clutter the screen with <code>position: fixed</code> elements. The <a data-featureid="viewportapi">Visual Viewport API</a> provides developers with a way to query and interact with the properties of the <em>visual viewport</em> (the box on the page that the user can currently see), and to be notified when these properties change.</p>

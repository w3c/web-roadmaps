      <h1>Spatial data on the Web (SDW) Roadmap</h1>
      <p>This is the roadmap for Spatial Data on the Web related features. Its scope includes any standards in any maturity phase that have to do with (geo)spatial data and the Web. This includes not only what the SDWIG is discussing and/or working on, but an overview of all relevant things that exist in SDW space. W3C, OGC and community standards are included. This roadmap does not list ALL OGC standards, as not all of them are of interest in a Web publication context. However, it does list all OGC standards that could be used in a Web publication context, even if they are not considered to be 'Webby' (i.e. not compliant to modern Web architecture). Those are listed under "Features not covered by ongoing work". </p>

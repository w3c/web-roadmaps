      <h1>Media Processing</h1>
      <p>Whether before rendering or after capture, media content often requires some processing to make it fit its expected usage.</p>

        <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
        <p data-feature="Image and Video Processing">The <a data-featureid="canvas">Canvas API</a> enables pixel-level manipulation of images and, by extension, video frames. One of its limitations is that it operates using the CPU instead of the more optimized operations enabled by modern GPUs.</p>
        <p data-feature="Video inserts">The <a data-featureid="mse">Media Source Extensions API</a> (MSE) allows application to insert chunks of media (e.g. a video clip) into an existing media stream.</p>
        <p data-feature="Protected Media">For the distribution of media whose content needs specific protection from being copied, the <a data-featureid="eme">Encrypted Media Extensions</a> specification enables the decryption and rendering of encrypted media streams based on Content Decryption Modules (CDM).</p>
        <p data-feature="Audio Processing">The <a data-featureid="webaudio">Web Audio API</a> provides a full-fledged audio processing and synthesis API with low-latency guarantees and hardware-accelerated operations when possible.</p>

        <h2>Exploratory work</h2>
        <div data-feature="Video processing">
          <p>Video processing using the Canvas API is very CPU-intensive. Beyond traditional video processing, modern GPUs often provide advanced vision processing capabilities (e.g. face and objects recognition) that would have direct applicability e.g. in augmented reality applications. The <a data-featureid="shape-detection">Shape Detection API</a> is exploring this space.</p>

        <h2>Features not covered by ongoing work</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>JavaScript-based Codecs</dt>
          <dd>The algorithms used to compress and decompress bandwidth-intensive media content are required to be provided by the browsers at this time; a system enabling these algorithms to be written and distributed in JavaScript or Web Assembly and get them integrated in the overall media flow of user agents would provide much greater freedom to specialize and innovate in this space (see <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/custom-image-audio-video-codec-apis/1270">related discussion on W3C’s discourse forum</a>).</dd>
          <dt>Ad-insertion with MSE</dt>
          <dd>Typical ads are of a very different nature than the media stream that they need to be inserted into. The Media Source Extensions specification does not address such heterogeneous scenarios, forcing content providers to use more complex workarounds, such as using two different <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements. MSE could be extended to support common ad-insertion use cases.</dd>
          <dt>Content Decryption Module API</dt>
          <dd>The capabilities offered by the Encrypted Media Extensions rely on the integration with undefined interfaces for the Content Decryption Modules. Providing a uniform interface for that integration would simplify the addition of new CDMs in the market.</dd>
          <dt>Conditional Access System</dt>
          <dd>Broadcasters use a different approach to protect the content they distribute, known as Conditional Access System (CAS). As broadcast streams are coming to Web browsers, providing integration with these systems may be needed.</dd>
          <dt>Hardware-accelerated video processing</dt>
          <dd>The Canvas API provides capabilities to do image and video processing, but these capabilities are limited by their reliance on the CPU for execution; modern GPUs provide hardware-acceleration for a wide range of operations, but browsers don't provide hooks to these. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/">GPU for the Web Community Group</a> is discussing solutions to expose GPU computation functionality to Web applications, which could eventually allow web applications to process video streams efficiently, taking advantage of the GPU power.</dd>

        <h2>Discontinued features</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Media Capture Stream with Worker</dt>
          <dd>Video processing using the Canvas API is very CPU intensive, and as such, can benefit from executing separately from the rest of a Web application. The <a data-featureid="videoworker">Media Capture Stream with Worker</a> specification was an early approach to process video streams in a dedicated worker thread. That processing would still be done on the CPU though, and work on this document has been discontinued. Work in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/">GPU for the Web Community Group</a> could eventually allow Web applications to process video streams directly using the power of the GPU.</dd>
